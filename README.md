As part of a C language course at the Open University of Israel, my final project involved collaborating with a fellow student.
Together, we developed a program in C designed to take a text file written in Assembly language and translate it into binary code.
This project not only enhanced my coding skills but also emphasized teamwork and effective collaboration.
